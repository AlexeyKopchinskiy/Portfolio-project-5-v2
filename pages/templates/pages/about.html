        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>
          Whether you're here to read something that stirs your thoughts, write something that’s been echoing in your mind, or simply wander through the words of others — you’re in good company. We’re building a community where curiosity is celebrated, nuance is welcomed, and creativity is contagious.
        </p>

        <p>
          No algorithms telling you what to think. No noise drowning out your voice. Just a quiet corner of the internet where depth matters more than clicks, and connection matters more than metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
          And this is just the beginning. Soon, we’ll be opening doors to new features — spaces for collaboration, editorial tools, and ways to support the writers you love. If that sounds like something you want to be part of, stick around. Your voice belongs here.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">What’s Next</h2>
        <p>
          We’re actively developing a subscription system that will unlock premium features — including advanced editorial tools, exclusive content, and enhanced collaboration spaces. Whether you're a casual reader or a dedicated contributor, there will be something tailored for you.
        </p>
