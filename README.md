## Agile Methodology

This project was developed following the principles of Agile Methodology, with GitHub Issues serving as the central hub for tracking User Stories. Each story was carefully structured with Acceptance Criteria and associated Tasks, though some of these evolved during implementation as the technical requirements became clearer. Several related User Stories were later grouped into Epics to better reflect their interconnected nature. While some tasks were completed more quickly than expected, others required significantly more time and iteration. For better grouping and time-wise management User Stories where assigned to 6 Milestones (see screenshots below). A GitHub project "InnkwellBlog project" was created at the same time. GitHub project allowes using its Board views with filtering and grouping options.

![Kanband: Milestones](/static/img/readme/Agile-Methodology-Milestones.jpg)

</details>

To prioritize development effectively, I applied the MoSCoW Method ‚Äî categorizing each User Story as a 'Must Have', 'Should Have', 'Could Have', or 'Won‚Äôt Have'. Only the essential stories needed to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) were implemented in this phase, with lower-priority items deferred to the backlog for future development.

Visual tools like a Kanban board and issue tracking screenshots helped streamline progress and maintain clarity throughout the build. Overall, adopting Agile practices greatly improved my ability to organize, adapt, and manage time efficiently.

## Testing

üìù Testing Strategy Justification

In the context of this project, I have chosen to focus on thorough manual testing rather than implementing automated testing. This decision is based on a careful evaluation of the project‚Äôs scope, complexity, and resource constraints.

‚úÖ Project Scope & Nature

The application is relatively lightweight, with a clear and well-defined set of user interactions ‚Äî such as viewing newsletters, navigating static pages, and submitting simple forms. These flows are straightforward to test manually and do not involve complex logic, high-volume data processing, or frequent regression scenarios that would typically justify automation.

‚úÖ Efficiency & Resource Allocation

Setting up automated testing ‚Äî including writing test cases, configuring test runners, and integrating CI pipelines ‚Äî would require a significant investment of time and effort. Given the limited scale of the project, this would not yield proportional benefits. Instead, I‚Äôve directed those resources toward refining the user experience, improving content quality, and ensuring mobile responsiveness ‚Äî areas that offer more tangible value to users and reviewers.

‚úÖ Manual Testing Coverage

I‚Äôve implemented a structured manual testing routine that covers:
  ‚Ä¢ Core functionality across all major pages
  ‚Ä¢ Mobile responsiveness and layout integrity
  ‚Ä¢ Content accuracy and dynamic rendering
  ‚Ä¢ SEO and accessibility essentials
  ‚Ä¢ Edge cases such as broken links, form validation, and navigation behavior
  ‚Ä¢ Code Validation
  ‚Ä¢ Lighthouse
  ‚Ä¢ Browser Compatibility
  ‚Ä¢ User Stories
  
This routine is documented and repeatable, ensuring consistent quality checks after each deployment and update.

‚úÖ Future Considerations

Should the project evolve into a larger platform with more dynamic features, user-generated content, or frequent updates, I would absolutely revisit the testing strategy and introduce automation where it becomes beneficial. For now, however, manual testing offers the best balance of coverage, efficiency, and maintainability.
By tailoring the testing approach to the actual needs of the project, I‚Äôve ensured that time and effort are spent where they matter most ‚Äî delivering a polished, functional, and user-friendly application.

üß≠ Manual Testing Scope: What to Cover

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of areas that were tested manually, grouped by priority:

üîπ Core Functionality

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Homepage loads correctly
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Navigation menu works across screen sizes
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Newsletter cards link to correct detail views
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Forms (contact, signup, etc.) submit and validate properly
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Sitemap.xml is accessible from the menu

üîπ Content Accuracy

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Newsletter titles, dates, and previews display correctly
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Truncated content doesn‚Äôt show images (as intended)
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Static pages (About, Privacy, etc.) render expected content

üîπ Mobile Responsiveness

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Navbar collapses and expands correctly
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Buttons and links are tappable without overlap
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Font sizes and layout adapt to small screens

üîπ Visual Consistency

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Buttons have correct styling (e.g. newsletter ‚ÄúView‚Äù button)
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Headings and spacing look clean across pages
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ No broken images or layout shifts

üîπ Code Validation with W3C Validator 

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Start page validation: Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.

  
  ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Errors related to Summernote WISIWIG text editor:
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è HTML Validation Notes
  During development, the project was tested using the W3C HTML Validator to ensure semantic correctness and structural integrity. While most validation issues were addressed, a few remaining errors are directly related to the integration of third-party components ‚Äî specifically the Summernote WYSIWYG editor used in the comment form.
  ‚ùå Known Validation Issues
    ‚Ä¢ Use of non-standard attributes such as summernote="{...}" on <textarea> elements
    ‚Ä¢ Improper use of hidden="true" instead of the boolean hidden attribute
    ‚Ä¢ Injection of <style> and <script> tags inside <p> elements, violating HTML content model rules
  These issues are not introduced by custom code, but are generated by Summernote‚Äôs rendering engine. Modifying or overriding this behavior would require deep customization of the widget‚Äôs internals, which is outside the scope of this project and could compromise stability or future compatibility.
  ‚úÖ Justification
    ‚Ä¢ The Summernote editor functions correctly across modern browsers and does not impact user experience or accessibility.
    ‚Ä¢ The errors do not affect layout, responsiveness, or form submission.
    ‚Ä¢ Attempting to "fix" these errors would involve rewriting third-party logic, which is impractical and unnecessary for this project‚Äôs goals.
  üß† Developer‚Äôs Note
  All custom HTML and Django templates have been validated and corrected where possible. Remaining issues are acknowledged and documented here for transparency. Should the project evolve into a production-grade platform, alternative editors or deeper integration strategies may be considered to achieve full compliance.

üîπ SEO & Accessibility

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Meta tags are present (viewport, description, etc.)
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Sitemap.xml is reachable and correctly formatted
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Alt text on images (if any)
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation works

## üìñ Project Overview

This platform allows authors to manage and monetize content while providing a premium experience for paid subscribers. The goal is to provide a clean, SEO-optimized, and secure blogging space with real e-commerce functionality.

## Agile Methodology

This project was developed using Agile principles, with GitHub Issues serving as the central hub for tracking User Stories ‚Äî you can view them [here](https://github.com/AlexeyKopchinskiy/Portfolio-project-5-v2/issues). For better accessibility and organization, all issues were grouped into a dedicated GitHub Project, allowing me to visualize progress and manage priorities more effectively. This project called InkwellBlog project can be found [here](https://github.com/users/AlexeyKopchinskiy/projects/12).

Each User Story was defined with clear Acceptance Criteria and associated Tasks. As the project evolved, I occasionally revised these tasks post-implementation, since the exact steps needed to meet the criteria weren‚Äôt always obvious at the outset.

Being my only second project using both Agile and the Django framework, the process was still on a learning curve. Some initially separate User Stories were later grouped into Epics, as their functionality turned out to be closely related. Interestingly, while a few tasks were completed more quickly than expected, others required significantly more time and iteration.

To prioritize effectively, I applied the MoSCoW method ‚Äî categorizing each User Story as a 'Must Have', 'Should Have', or 'Could Have'. A handful of "Won‚Äôt Have" items were intentionally left in the backlog for potential future development. My focus was on crafting just enough stories to reach a solid Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Most of the stories were also labeled as 'Developer stories', 'Site owner stories' or 'Visitor stories'

### üöÄ Agile Workflow

- Agile board managed with GitHub Issues and Milestones  
- User stories split into:
  - Developer stories
  - Site owner stories
  - Visitor stories
- Labels include `Must-Have`, `Should-Have`, and `Could-Have`
- Milestones:
  - Project Setup
  - Auth & Roles
  - E-Commerce
  - Blog Engine
  - UX/UI
  - SEO & Marketing
  - Testing & Deployment

Screenshots of the Kanban board, Epics, and User Stories illustrate this workflow.

Overall, adopting Agile proved invaluable. It gave structure to my development process and helped me manage my time more intentionally ‚Äî even without fixed-length iterations. And yes, moving tasks from 'To Do' to 'Done' was genuinely satisfying.


## üéØ Project Purpose & Rationale

This web application was developed to support a multi-role content platform that facilitates publishing, reviewing, and engaging with written content. It is designed with four distinct user roles ‚Äî **Readers**, **Authors**, **Reviewers**, and **Administrators** ‚Äî each with tailored access, responsibilities, and interfaces.

The rationale behind the project is grounded in real-world user needs and is shaped by the following user stories and personas:

---

- Discover and read the latest published posts.
- View and manage their own comment history.
- Navigate the platform easily across devices.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Recent comments panel.
- Sidebar with latest published posts.
- Mobile-responsive layout for reading on the go.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Author

**Persona:** Content creators who write and submit posts or newsletters.

**Needs:**
- Draft and edit posts before submission.
- Track published content and engagement.
- View recent feedback or comments on their work.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Drafts and published newsletters.
- Recent authored posts.
- Comment activity related to their content.

---

### üïµÔ∏è Reviewer

---

## üß† Why This Matters

By clearly defining and implementing role-based access and dashboards, the application ensures that each user interacts with the platform in a way that aligns with their goals. This structure promotes:

- ‚úÖ **Security**: Users only access what they‚Äôre authorized to see.
- ‚úÖ **Usability**: Dashboards are tailored to each role‚Äôs workflow.
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: New roles or features can be added without disrupting existing flows.
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns across views and templates.

The project demonstrates a thoughtful approach to user-centered design, with each feature grounded in a specific user story. It‚Äôs not just a technical build ‚Äî it‚Äôs a solution to real communication and content management needs.
